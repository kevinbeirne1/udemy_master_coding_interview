## Why
Up to this point I have had only cursory engagement with data structures and algorithms. 
On the recommendation of a friend I decided to take this course. 

## Repo Structure
The repo has python and javascript directories that contains code for the same problems solved in both javascript and python. 
The udemy course is taught in javascript, and at this point in time python is my primary coding language
I decided to try challenge myself by solving in both languages to increase my proficiency in Javascript, and to better understand how to translate concepts from one language to the other
